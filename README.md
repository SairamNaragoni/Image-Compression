 # Image-Compression
* An Image Compression Software
* Using Discrete Cosine Transformation(DCT)
* The software gives a Lossy Image Compression with low quality setting else
  The luminance is preserved
 
 
## Description
> The Following Operations are performed individually on R G B of Image <br />
> The Software First Computes DCT on the input image <br />
> Then Applies Mask on the image according to the set quality <br />
> It inverses the DCT <br />
> The concatenation of R G B is the Compresed Image <br />
